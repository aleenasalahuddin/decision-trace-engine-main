# Decision Trace Engine (DTE)

Decision Trace Engine is a web-based cognitive analysis tool designed to
deconstruct human decision-making into structured reasoning components.
It helps users surface hidden assumptions, cognitive biases, missing
information, and confidence misalignment behind important decisions.

## What it does
- Accepts a user-described decision
- Breaks the decision into explicit assumptions
- Identifies potential cognitive and emotional biases
- Highlights missing or unvalidated information
- Produces a structured decision trace report
- Generates a confidence and risk assessment summary

## Use cases
- Strategic and executive decision review
- Career and personal decision analysis
- Product and business tradeoff evaluation
- Cognitive bias awareness and reasoning audits

## Tech stack
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Component-driven UI architecture

## Local development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
Deployment
The application is deployed as a production web application and can be
hosted on any modern frontend platform such as Vercel.

Project status
Version 1 — functional MVP focusing on structured decision analysis.
Future iterations may include persistence, reporting exports, and
multi-decision comparisons.
